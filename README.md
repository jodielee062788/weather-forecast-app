# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to check the weather outlook for multiple cities. It features a user-friendly interface where users can search for a city and view both current and future weather conditions. The application utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data.

### Problem Solving

The Weather Dashboard addresses the need of travelers who want to plan their trips by providing up-to-date weather information for various cities. It uses third-party APIs to fetch real-time weather data and displays it in a clear and concise manner.

### Learning

While working on this project, I gained experience in working with third-party APIs, specifically the OpenWeatherMap API. I learned how to make API requests, handle responses, and dynamically update the HTML and CSS of a web page based on the retrieved data.
